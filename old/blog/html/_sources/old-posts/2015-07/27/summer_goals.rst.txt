Summer 2015. My first summer away from home, working full time. It's been a busy one
and very different for me. Since I won't be at home, I've decided to make a few goals
for myself to stay busy. Here they are:

1. Eat 'Paleo' for 30 days

2. Lose 20 lbs. 

3. Implement something non-trivial in Rust

4. Make music.tfahl.com work and pretty with HTML/CSS/Javascript

5. Make Pong in Unity

These goals have been things I've been meaning to get around to, but I could never find the
time to finish. I tried to make them as tangible as possible, but "non-trivial" and "pretty"
are decently subjective, so I may work on refining those.

Now, as of writing this, it's July 27th, a good way into the summer. But thankfully I have
started or already met some of these goals. I have through Wednesday left and I'll have 
officially finished my paleo diet; I have lost around 15 lbs. already; I have learned a
small amount of rust as well as HTML and CSS; and I have started Pong and have one paddle working.
So far this summer has been a success, but I need to have more tangible goals for 3 and 4.
